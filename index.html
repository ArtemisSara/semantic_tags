    <p> Was he a genius or a madman? Perhaps a little bit of both. It could be argued that we all possess a little bit of this and a little bit of that from time to time. Edgar, however, had a claim on more than his fair share.</p>

    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <p>Poe quarreled with his foster father John Allan over the funds for his education.  Like any young man with a chip on his shoulder would do this spurred him onto enlisting in the Army...under an assumed name. But was that madness or genius?</p>

    <h3>Probably Genius</h3>
    <p>As a result of joining the army he was able to kickstart his career in literature.  How's that for genius over madness?</p>
